NCE was among the rst in the machine tool industry to incorporate PC based CNC technology.NCE has always used the highest quality ground ballscrews and linear guides available. The machine base, slides and tooling plate are precision-machined in America. In 1994 we began producing the OmniTurn GT-75. The GT-75 is a fully enclosed slant-bed turning center with American-made high-precision spindle, pneumatic collet closer, ood coolant, and work lamp. In 1998 we introduced the OmniTurn GT-Jr. The GT-Jr has the same rugged and precise base, table and spindle as the GT-75, but without the enclosure, which allows for very fast change-over and setup. OmniTurns are fast, precise and aordable. They are also reliable, easy to operate and inexpensive to maintain. There are thousands of OmniTurns in use throughout the country earning a prot for large corporations as well as ‘garage-shops’. This machine is built entirely at our factory in Oregon. Easy setup! The GT-75 is shipped in a wooden frame as illustrated, for easy pallet-jack maneuvering into place in your shop. Air requirements are minimal: less than 3cfm at 80psi. Electrical power requirements are 220vac single or three-phase, 20 amps.  The machine does not need to be bolted down.  Leveling pads are included; simply adjust each pad to stabilize the machine.  You can set up your OmniTurn GT-75 with no special tools, and be ready to run parts very quickly.","@ID":7},{"#text":"","@ID":21},{"#text":"Claire Horlings Editor claire@industrialtimesinc.com Derek Smith Graphic Designer | Production Web Content derek@industrialtimesinc.com Lisa Grimes Administrative & Sales Assistant lisa@industrialtimesinc.com Contact Us 1930 Fuller Avenue  Ste.

It’s a demanding environment. As a solution, many of these shops are installing Mitsui Seiki horizontal and vertical 4- and 5-axis CNC machining centers. Why? Capability. Cost. Reliability. They know they need the most precise machine they can buy. They understand how our hand scraping gets them the absolute best volumetric accuracy. They know our machines are designed and built so well they get more life out of them – typically four times longer than most other brands. Robust construction techniques and materials, along with heavy duty components, provide the rigidity and ruggedness they need – from the first roughing operations to the final finishing cuts. They experience our support organization, and recognize what a difference this makes in maintaining their business. For these shops, it just makes the most profitable sense to buy the best made machine tool to get the best made parts. To compete now and in the challenging years ahead, doesn’t it make sense for your shop, too? Invest wisely, and look for low operating costs with high returns. Take a closer look at Mitsui Seiki.
