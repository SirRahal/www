        Results
    </div>
    After the ad is sent out, we wait one week for the results. The results consist of the number of emails that were sent, bounced, opened, marked as spam, unsubscribed, and how many links were clicked on in the email.
    We take good care of our clientele to ensure that our contact list stays as prestigious as possible.  We do share all of our results to our clients and customers with specific detail.
